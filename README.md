# LED MATRIX <br>
<br>
    This is a project on an LED matrix display. The project is for an 8x8 display. I do not recommend you work with the PCB given but it can act as a reference point if you do intend to make this. The PCB tracing was done hastily and was left to the "auto router" itself. It isn't complete work. There are other issues with the delay and inputs but it is minor. <br>
# Parts List
<br>
    <ul>
        <li> Shift registers (74HC595) * 2 </li>
        <li> Perf board * 1 </li>
        <li> Red LEDs * 64 </li>
        <li> Jumper cables </li>
        <li> Bread boards * 2 </li>
        <li> Reset switch * 4 </li>
        <li> NPN transistors (BC547) * 8 </li>
        <li> Other miscellaneous stuff (resistors of different values. This is mentioned in the schematic. There was minor deviation throughout it during the project however) </li>
    </ul>
